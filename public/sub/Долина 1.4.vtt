00:10.636 --> 00:12.011
Richie!

00:13.555 --> 00:15.598
- Right on time.
- Hey. You're the lawyer?

00:15.724 --> 00:17.684
Ron LaFlamme. Great to meet you.

00:17.768 --> 00:18.935
(GRUNTS)

00:19.269 --> 00:20.895
All right, homeboy. Pop a squat.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.397
Start autographing by the flags.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.107
Lot of paper to get through.

00:30.197 --> 00:33.074
So, what do you think?

00:33.158 --> 00:34.325
About?

00:35.285 --> 00:37.412
Jeannie. She's pretty hot, right?

00:37.788 --> 00:40.289
Oh, yeah. No, she's... She's very pretty.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.749
Yeah, she is.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.543
Oh, we're doing that. Okay.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.336
(CHUCKLES)

00:45.796 --> 00:47.755
So yo, Peter tells me you're
popping your cherry with this.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.090
So let me just walk you through it.

00:49.216 --> 00:52.385
That stuff you're signing gives you
the convertible note for funding

00:52.469 --> 00:54.971
and establishes you and Peter Gregory

00:55.097 --> 00:59.100
as the board members of Pied Piper,
incorporated in the state of Delaware.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.227
Okay. Why Delaware?

01:01.353 --> 01:03.062
Rich, Rich.

01:03.147 --> 01:06.399
Lawyer, not lawyer. I got you.

01:07.359 --> 01:11.738
So, Peter Gregory, big fan of you.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.906
- Oh.
- He invited you to his toga party, right?

01:13.991 --> 01:15.867
That's a big deal. Flo Rida's playing.

01:15.951 --> 01:17.827
- You dig Flo Rida?
- Should be fun.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.704
- Yeah, I went to a lot...
- See this guitar?

01:20.164 --> 01:22.623
Sergey and Larry from Google signed it.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.876
Both of them. Right there.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.337
(STRUMS OFF-TUNE)

01:28.380 --> 01:30.465
So, Pied Piper.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.842
You're one of Peter's
compression plays, huh?

01:34.052 --> 01:36.012
One of? How many does he have?

01:36.346 --> 01:37.847
Not too many. Like six or eight.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.057
Okay. Why are there so many?

01:40.184 --> 01:42.935
You know how sea turtles
have a shit-ton of babies

01:43.020 --> 01:45.438
because most of them die
on their way down to the water?

01:45.856 --> 01:48.900
Peterjust wants to make sure
that his money makes it to the ocean.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.777
But it seems like you
got your shit together.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.695
A lot of these guys come in here

01:52.780 --> 01:54.530
and they can do all the engineering stuff

01:54.698 --> 01:56.657
but they get all hung up on technicalities.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.535
They can't just tell you
what their vision for the company is.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.662
Those guys are so fucked.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.749
It's like you need both halves
of the brain, right?

02:04.833 --> 02:08.419
The Jobs and the Wozniak.
The ying and the yang.

02:08.879 --> 02:11.088
Oh. I think it's "Yin".

02:11.465 --> 02:13.007
- "Yin"? (CHUCKLES)
- Yeah.

02:13.342 --> 02:17.178
- Like "Yin and yan?"
- No. Like yin and yang.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.223
No. it's ying and yang, they're opposites.

02:20.516 --> 02:23.559
So, Pied Piper, drop it on me. What is it?

02:24.728 --> 02:26.687
Well, we started off as a music app.

02:26.772 --> 02:27.814
Yuck.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.275
Yeah. Gross.
(AWKWARD CHUCKLE)

02:31.360 --> 02:33.820
But we've pivoted since then.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.905
Uh-oh. To what?

02:35.989 --> 02:39.325
Well, our Weissman scores
are consistently high across all media,

02:39.409 --> 02:41.410
audio, video, meta-data.

02:41.537 --> 02:44.497
Actually, that's not true.
We've had some trouble encoding 3D video.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.957
- I think it's because the pixels change...
- (STRUMMING GUITAR)

02:46.041 --> 02:49.836
- value differently than conventional...
- (PLAYING GUITAR THROUGH AMPLIFIER)

03:06.728 --> 03:07.770
Just look at the flow diagram, dude.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.231
No, the filter bank
is part of the prediction loop.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.442
What are you talking about,
this is lossless compression.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.696
Oh, hey, Big Head, you were there.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.115
Why did Richard use a DCT filter bank?

03:20.617 --> 03:21.617
Oh...

03:23.245 --> 03:25.913
Not really sure.
Richard tried to explain some of this stuff

03:25.998 --> 03:27.373
but a lot of it I didn't really understand,

03:27.457 --> 03:29.458
so I'd kinda just nod and smile, you know?

03:30.002 --> 03:33.254
Can you at least help us figure out
this insane DFT spider web he's using?

03:34.423 --> 03:35.423
(CHORTLES)

03:38.468 --> 03:41.178
Dude, do you understand any of this?

03:46.977 --> 03:48.144
I eat the fish.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.937
I understand you eat the fish.

03:50.314 --> 03:51.856
But when you clean the fish

03:52.065 --> 03:55.026
you can't leave the fish head
and guts and shit in the sink.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.194
Because the whole house
smells like a bait station.

03:57.571 --> 04:01.115
So you gotta put it in the trash
and then take the trash out.

04:01.825 --> 04:02.992
Do you understand?

04:03.619 --> 04:05.536
Yes. I eat the fish.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.121
Motherfuck!

04:08.540 --> 04:11.918
Do you know how awkward it is to not be
able to describe your own company?

04:12.002 --> 04:13.753
Like, I built Pied Piper and you can see it

04:13.837 --> 04:15.880
but I can't really
describe to you what it is

04:15.964 --> 04:17.757
even though I kind of know where I'm going.

04:17.841 --> 04:21.010
You do realize we quit working
on our own apps to work for you, right?

04:21.094 --> 04:24.680
Shouldn't you more than
"Kind of know where you're going?"

04:24.806 --> 04:26.849
Because that's basically what the CEO does.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.310
I do. Sort of.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.438
RICHARD: Okay, it's like trying to tell
someone how to get somewhere,

04:32.564 --> 04:34.565
even though you don't really know
the exact address. Right?

04:34.691 --> 04:36.442
Like, how do you do that?
Because you can't just say

04:36.526 --> 04:37.610
"Go to 415 Elm Street,"

04:37.694 --> 04:39.028
because you don't even know
what that is. Right?

04:39.154 --> 04:40.446
So you have to say, you know,

04:40.530 --> 04:43.366
"Go straight down that big road
and take a right at the weird thing."

04:43.492 --> 04:44.700
But, you can't describe
what that weird thing is

04:44.785 --> 04:46.825
because you just know
it as a weird thing, you know,

04:46.995 --> 04:48.287
in your head. You always have.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.706
Ls that weird thing in
your head an aneurysm?

04:51.249 --> 04:53.918
Richard, I'm just gonna recap for a second,

04:54.544 --> 04:56.504
you turned down 10 million dollars

04:56.588 --> 05:00.132
to be able to develop something that you,
as the head of the company,

05:00.217 --> 05:02.510
can't even describe to another human being?

05:03.387 --> 05:05.179
I say this only to motivate you.

05:06.890 --> 05:10.935
Okay, so I have been
instructed to remove you

05:11.061 --> 05:13.813
from the list of employees
assigned to the Nucleus project.

05:14.064 --> 05:17.692
You will no longer receive any
Nucleus related communications,

05:18.568 --> 05:21.487
file reports, or attend
any Nucleus meetings.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.531
Any questions?

05:24.533 --> 05:27.118
No. That's... That's pretty clear.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.619
Great.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.247
Am I being reassigned to something else?

05:31.623 --> 05:35.710
Not that I am aware of. At this time. No.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.169
Wait, so then am I being fired?

05:37.254 --> 05:39.964
Because I have a three year contract
and my stock options...

05:40.048 --> 05:43.134
Okay. Nobody is being fired. Okay?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.678
Look, a contract is a contract.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.390
You know. You've got a contract.
And I've got a contract.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.392
We all have contracts.

05:51.476 --> 05:55.354
And here at Hooli, contracts are honored.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.606
Yours and mine.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.192
Everybody's. So...

06:01.445 --> 06:02.862
Have I made that perfectly clear?

06:03.113 --> 06:04.947
Yeah, no. That's clear.

06:05.991 --> 06:10.786
But, when I come into work
tomorrow, what do I do?

06:12.706 --> 06:15.624
That is unclear. At this time.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.796
- (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
- (CHATTER)

06:24.926 --> 06:27.046
Should've worn more than
my underwear and a bed sheet.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.057
- Underwear? Pussy.
- Yeah. I'm with him.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.976
This is the type of evening
that requires free-balling.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.981
Oh. I'm gonna take my underwear off too.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.067
Richard! Hey, you made it!

06:42.152 --> 06:45.946
So Peter met with LaFlamme today
and signed the paperwork,

06:46.031 --> 06:48.991
which means Pied Piper
is officially launched.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.947
Why didn't you tell me about all the
other compression plays Peter was seeding?

06:52.996 --> 06:57.291
What? No... Because it's nothing
you need to worry about.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.919
Because none of those other
companies have your vision.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.004
- My vision?
- Exactly.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.340
Speaking of which,
Peter really wants you to come in on Friday

07:04.424 --> 07:05.841
to chat about big picture stuff.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.760
You know, lay out your vision
in broad strokes.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.762
Broad strokes for the vision of the...

07:09.930 --> 07:12.890
Well, Pied Piper is compression
and we all know that.

07:13.016 --> 07:16.894
So we don't need to talk about that,
but I could because I'm the CEO.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.064
Pied Piper takes the data and...

07:21.191 --> 07:22.525
Smaller... To smaller form.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.319
And, also, there's more.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.322
It compresses the data overall...

07:29.449 --> 07:31.534
Excuse me. See you Friday. Hi Tom.

07:33.745 --> 07:34.912

07:39.543 --> 07:41.460
GILFOYLE: Richard, pace yourself, buddy.

07:42.003 --> 07:46.382
You know, I wish this was Roman times.
You know?

07:46.591 --> 07:48.092
Life was simpler back then.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.136
Simpler for you. I would have been a slave.

07:50.595 --> 07:51.887
There's still time.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.225
Cool costume. Where'd you get it?

08:00.105 --> 08:01.438
- My bed.
- (LAUGHS)

08:01.523 --> 08:03.232
- You're funny!
- Oh.

I'm Brooke and this is my friend Anastasia.

08:06.570 --> 08:07.736
Hi.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.573
- Hi.
- What's up, guys?

08:10.740 --> 08:11.740
(GIGGLING)

08:12.993 --> 08:14.493
So, how do you know Peter Gregory?

08:14.661 --> 08:15.870
Oh, through work.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.080
We're actresses.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.082
Cool.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.709
What type of actressing work?

08:21.793 --> 08:23.169
Oh, we're working right now.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.422
Our startup sources actors
to parties to liven things up

08:26.506 --> 08:29.717
and get into conversations with guests
and be interested in them.

08:32.762 --> 08:33.846
RICHARD: Oh, neat.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.015
So, who else is paid to be here?

08:36.099 --> 08:39.393
Pretty much anyone that's
over a seven is with us,

08:39.477 --> 08:41.520
and anyone that's under a three is a guest.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.189
It's a really fun job.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.275
- Plus, I get to work with my boyfriend.
- Yeah.

09:48.380 --> 09:51.507
I hope that you enjoy the party.

09:52.342 --> 09:56.136
There is a second bar in back

09:56.846 --> 09:59.014
where the line is much shorter.

Thank you. I'm finished now.

- Yep.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.505
It's like, I don't have any...

- Game.
- Game, yes! That's it.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.468
You know, I always knew
I was missing something

10:36.553 --> 10:39.138
and then someone explained
to me the concept of game,

10:39.222 --> 10:44.268
I remember very distinctly thinking,
"That's what I don't have. Game."

10:47.063 --> 10:48.272
Sorry.

- What's up, Richie Rich?

11:08.835 --> 11:10.586
Great seeing you last night, buddy.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.796
Just wanted you to know I had my associate

11:12.881 --> 11:16.258
draft up everything like we talked about
and it is all good.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.261
Just emailed you the board consent
which appoints your new board member.

11:19.387 --> 11:23.682
So just print it, sign it,
get it to Gregory to sign and it is donezo.

11:52.796 --> 11:56.465
Oh, boy. Here, I brought you something
for your stomach.

11:56.925 --> 12:00.302
Be forewarned,
the orange juice has vodka in it.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.388
Little hair of the dog.
(CHUCKLES)

12:03.348 --> 12:06.725
What exactly happened last night,
from your side?

12:06.810 --> 12:09.311
We happened, Richard. And the best part is,

12:09.479 --> 12:10.979
we can relive it whenever we want to.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.816
(CHATTER FROM VIDEO)

12:14.359 --> 12:16.819
We're two halves of the same brain!

12:17.987 --> 12:19.405
You complete me!

12:19.489 --> 12:21.824
Don't ever say that again!
Do you understand me?

12:22.367 --> 12:23.992
I will beat the shit out of you.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.452
Yo, yo, get that camera out my face.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.413
ERLICH: Come on, Mr. Rida. Okay. Okay.

12:27.831 --> 12:31.250
- Look at this part.
- I'm asking this fat, beautiful man...

12:31.334 --> 12:34.461
- (LAUGHING)
- ...in front of God and the Flo Rider

12:34.546 --> 12:37.464
and this white, weird cocaine statue

12:38.508 --> 12:41.510
to be on the Pied Piper board of directors.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.847
- Yes! A thousand times, yes!
- He's doin' it!

12:45.974 --> 12:47.474
- Shake on it.
- It's a deal.

12:47.559 --> 12:48.684
(WHISPERING) Oh, no.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.520
Plus, we have this
for the Pied Piper documentary

12:51.604 --> 12:52.925
that we're eventually gonna make.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.732
We're making history together, partner.

12:57.694 --> 12:58.694
(SIGHS)

12:58.778 --> 13:00.696
Are you dressed like Steve Jobs?

13:01.698 --> 13:02.990
Oh, am I?
(CHUCKLES)

13:03.408 --> 13:06.535
Well, I suppose Steve and I
always have shared a similar aesthetic.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.553
(WHISTLES)
Hey.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.430
Little help?

13:27.098 --> 13:28.223
Oh. Okay.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.642
- (GRUNTS)
- (HACKY SACK HITS WALL)

13:47.410 --> 13:48.869
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.

13:49.245 --> 13:52.080
Sorry about the throw. Bursitis.

13:52.457 --> 13:53.499
Yeah.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.335
So, you guys having a meeting up here?

13:56.753 --> 13:58.128
(QUIET LAUGHTER)

13:59.339 --> 14:00.547
No. Not exactly.

14:00.882 --> 14:03.717
We're all currently unassigned.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.136
How about you?

14:06.221 --> 14:07.638
- Yeah. Unassigned.
- Yeah.

14:07.722 --> 14:08.722
(CHUCKLES)

14:08.806 --> 14:10.432
- That's cool.
- MAN: Yeah.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.792
How could you put Erlich on the board?
What were you thinking?

14:15.355 --> 14:17.898
You don't put someone inside
the company on the board.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.994
Then he and Peter Gregory can vote you out.

14:20.151 --> 14:23.403
Yeah. You gotta find an outsider you trust.
Like your mom.

14:23.821 --> 14:27.824
I'd put Erlich on the board before my mom.
Backstabbing bitch.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.536
Guys, I was drunk, okay?

14:30.787 --> 14:32.913
You know, I half-jokingly
said to Gilfoyle last night,

14:32.997 --> 14:35.158
"it looks like Richard
is going to suck Erlich's dick."

14:35.583 --> 14:37.417
But that would be reasonable
compared to this.

14:38.169 --> 14:40.629
Richard, could I speak to you?

14:41.756 --> 14:43.715
Okay. Yeah.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.723
He's the least cool guy I've ever met.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.642
I heard about what's been happening.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.271
I have to say, I'm a little disappointed.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.982
Yeah, I don't...
I don't know what I was thinking.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.942
Yes. I mean,

15:02.318 --> 15:05.237
is there a reason I wasn't
invited to the party?

15:05.572 --> 15:08.031
Is there some sense that
I'm not part of the gang?

15:08.324 --> 15:10.951
What? Jared.

15:11.286 --> 15:14.955
Of course not. it was just an oversight.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.207
I mean, we weren't even sure
if we were gonna go.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.377
And what was it like there?

15:20.795 --> 15:22.629
Were there gelatin shots?

15:23.464 --> 15:27.342
No. No, it was stupid and loud.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.927
Honestly, you're better off.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.346
I suppose. I had a fine night.

15:32.390 --> 15:36.518
I had some palak paneer
and I watched a documentary about Liberia.

15:36.811 --> 15:41.064
But then I woke up to this
unexpected development.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.567
Do you...
Do you really want Erlich on the board?

15:43.693 --> 15:47.070
- Because I'll support you...
- No. I don't. At all.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.197
I was drunk.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.560
I don't know how to get out of it.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.952
I mean, what am I going
to say to Peter Gregory?

15:54.871 --> 15:58.032
Well, if you don't sign the documents,
and you don't give them to Peter Gregory,

15:58.041 --> 15:59.750
then it won't happen. Simple as that.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.377
Really? I...

16:03.129 --> 16:04.212
Wow. Okay.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.297
(SIGHS)

16:05.381 --> 16:07.424
That is a relief, Jared. Thanks.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.845
I'm glad you're around.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.223
Well, keep that in mind for future parties.

16:15.975 --> 16:16.975
(CHUCKLES)

16:17.477 --> 16:19.811
Honestly, sometimes we forget you're here.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.564
ERLICH: You guys, company photo time
out back. Let's go!

16:23.107 --> 16:25.859
Gilfoyle, okay, off to
the center a little bit.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.653
Like your personality. No, no, no, no.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.197
Dinesh, leave it unbuttoned.
We want you to look like shit.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.032
Makes for a better "Before" photo.

16:32.367 --> 16:33.617
But you're wearing a jacket.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.078
Yeah, because I'm the genius marketer.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.788
I'm not a code freak like you guys.

16:37.955 --> 16:41.750
Besides, I'm wearing sandals
so I am iconoclasting a little bit.

16:42.126 --> 16:45.045
Oh, good. Jared.
What the fuck is with that vest?

16:45.254 --> 16:48.048
Right over here.
As if you're sort of a late addition

16:48.132 --> 16:51.468
that may not stick around
for the entire duration of the company.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.221
And then, Richard.
There you go. The man of the hour.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.640
Okay. We'll take a few like this,

16:57.392 --> 16:59.768
and then just Richard and I.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.436
Because at the end of the day,

17:01.938 --> 17:05.148
people only want to see a picture
of the board members.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.402
Lt... Actually, it's...

17:10.071 --> 17:11.697
You're not gonna be a board member.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.615
- What?
- (CAMERA BEEPING)

17:14.450 --> 17:15.492
(CAMERA CLICKS)

17:15.576 --> 17:17.452
I'm in year three of a five year deal

17:17.537 --> 17:19.538
and, Matt, you got what,
like three years left?

17:19.914 --> 17:22.124
Yeah. We all got acquired by Hooli,

17:22.208 --> 17:25.001
when we didn't work out,
none of us got reassigned.

17:25.086 --> 17:29.506
Because Gavin believes in this
Japanese form of management

17:29.632 --> 17:32.926
where not being assigned
is the most shameful outcome.

17:33.136 --> 17:34.136
(LAUGHTER)

17:35.638 --> 17:37.472
Yeah, it does feel uncomfortable.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.225
Give it a week or two,
you'll get, like, numb to it.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.954
Well, why are you guys still coming in?

17:42.228 --> 17:43.812
Rest and vest.

17:44.355 --> 17:45.397
Oh...

17:45.481 --> 17:47.733
Because in order to fully
vest your options,

17:47.817 --> 17:50.402
you've gotta wait until
your contracts are up.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.529
- I get it.
- You catch on slow.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.239
You'll fit right in here.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.284
Lunch? Arby's on El Camino? I'll drive.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.619
No, let's walk. it'll take longer.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.509
Gotta do something to fill the day, right?

18:01.706 --> 18:03.790
I was drunk! You took advantage of me!

18:03.875 --> 18:06.395
- Man, they are really going at it.
- (ERLICH CONTINUES YELLING)

18:06.586 --> 18:11.006
So, last night, what was
the girl situation?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.717
And after all I've given
up for this company.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.302
Oh, what have you given up?

18:15.553 --> 18:18.847
I owned 10% of Dinesh's app,
10% of Gilfoyle's app.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.183
Multiple potential streams of income.

18:21.309 --> 18:24.436
Not to mention that 100%
of the team that you have,

18:24.520 --> 18:26.688
were all guys that I
recruited for this house.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.065
- That must be worth something to me.
- Lt is.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.776
10% of Pied Piper!

18:30.860 --> 18:33.528
For which I forewent,
yes, that's a real word,

18:33.696 --> 18:35.572
one million dollars.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.533
I supported you, Richard. I bet on you.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.911
And now you're just gonna
give me a seat on the board,

18:40.995 --> 18:42.746
only to retract that offer?

18:42.830 --> 18:44.873
I can't even remember doing that!

18:44.999 --> 18:48.543
Oh, really? Well, do you remember
this particular dick-bag I got on video?

18:49.253 --> 18:50.378
Because you did.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.006
Put it away.

18:53.508 --> 18:54.633
It's right here.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.302
Goddammit.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.151
- I've seen the video.
- It's the wrong album, just give me a sec...

19:00.181 --> 19:01.181
You know what? Fuck it!

19:01.265 --> 19:03.725
You offering me a position on this board
and reneging it

19:03.893 --> 19:06.228
is a perfect example of
you having no vision,

19:06.395 --> 19:08.355
no balls and no game.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.273
Maybe he did blow him.

19:11.192 --> 19:13.985
- Well, love and hate. it's all passion.
- (ERLICH CONTINUES YELLING)

19:14.403 --> 19:16.112
And if that's the kind of
company you wanna run,

19:16.239 --> 19:17.280
well, then, fine.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.908
God help you. 'Cause I sure as hell ain't.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.910
What are you doing?

19:21.994 --> 19:23.434
You give your loyalty to somebody...

19:23.454 --> 19:24.734
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch!

19:25.081 --> 19:26.581
I can do it myself.

19:26.958 --> 19:27.958
All right.

19:31.087 --> 19:34.089
I just put it back on. Goddammit!

19:36.551 --> 19:37.759
Okay. Read that back to me.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.137
"Pied Piper's mission is to bring its unique
compression algorithm to a variety..."

19:41.264 --> 19:42.848
One thing you should know
about living in this house

19:42.932 --> 19:44.724
is I do not tolerate substance abuse.

19:44.809 --> 19:47.519
There's no drinking and
lying in this house.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.522
I should have made that more clear
to some of the current residents.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.899
Like this one. Don't mind him.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.819
He'll be gone soon
when his company cakes its pants.

19:56.028 --> 19:59.656
Hopefully, Jurgen, you'll be able to bring
a more positive element to the house.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.469
Let me show you the room I'm offering.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.159
Some of his stuff is still in there,

20:03.244 --> 20:05.453
but, as I mentioned, it will soon be gone.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.748
Once his company cakes its pants.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.626
It's okay. Just take a breath.

20:11.836 --> 20:13.503
It's fine. I'm fine. We just...

20:13.588 --> 20:15.839
Let's get through this.
Okay, so, read this back to me.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.818
- "Pied Piper's mission..."
- Hey, guys.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.968
Hope you don't mind,
the front door was just open.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.220
Hi, Big Head. What's up?

20:22.346 --> 20:26.308
Honestly? Nothing.
I've just been sitting around all day.

20:26.475 --> 20:30.020
Not working. it's weird, you know?
(SIGHS)

20:30.104 --> 20:31.146
Yeah.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.359
- So, what's up with you guys?
- (RATTLING)

20:36.444 --> 20:37.736
We're just sort of...

20:37.862 --> 20:40.155
We're getting ready for this big
Peter Gregory meeting.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.908
And we have a lot of work to do, so...

20:44.160 --> 20:46.828
Cool. Very cool.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.205
(RATTLING CONTINUES)

20:49.290 --> 20:53.001
You know, Richard, the irony is that
if you had taken the ten million,

20:53.169 --> 20:55.253
you'd be kicking back
with a ton of money right now

20:55.338 --> 20:56.338
and I'd still be working.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.716
But you didn't, obviously.
And now I've got nothing to do,

20:59.800 --> 21:03.303
I'm rolling in it,
and you're working your ass off.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.847
Life's funny isn't it?

21:08.476 --> 21:10.018
You guys want to walk to Arby's,

21:10.102 --> 21:12.354
maybe grab a bite, play
a little hacky sack?

21:16.025 --> 21:18.944
Yeah. I should probably
get back to work, anyway.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.780
I mean, not work, exactly, I don't...

21:21.864 --> 21:24.741
I don't work.
But, you know, just get back to Hooli.

21:26.369 --> 21:29.162
Sit around all day and get paid
a bunch of money to do nothing.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.497
(CHUCKLES)
Weird.

21:34.377 --> 21:35.961
- You ready?
- (SIGHS)

21:36.045 --> 21:37.879
You know what you're going to say?
You want to run it by me?

21:37.964 --> 21:40.382
No, no. I got this. Fuck Erlich.

21:40.591 --> 21:43.111
You know, I turned down ten million dollars
to build this thing.

21:43.928 --> 21:46.805
You want vision,
I will show you fucking vision.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.224
I like this new angry side to you.

21:50.601 --> 21:53.770
Being around angry people relaxes me,
because I know where I stand.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.231
(SUCKS TEETH)

21:56.315 --> 21:58.149
Oh, shoot. I think I got something
stuck in my teeth.

21:58.234 --> 22:01.069
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom,
check it out. I'll be back in a sec.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.755
Richard, it's Jared. Are you okay?

22:21.924 --> 22:22.924
(DOOR UNLOCKS)

22:25.761 --> 22:27.262
(WATER RUNNING)

22:30.474 --> 22:34.728
Hey buddy, what's going on here?

22:35.396 --> 22:37.313
I thought I had something in my teeth,

22:37.606 --> 22:40.567
but when I looked over, right?
I looked in the mirror like this,

22:41.110 --> 22:42.569
my pants, they hit the countertop,

22:42.653 --> 22:44.529
and it must have some
water on there, right?

22:44.613 --> 22:47.734
So I got a spot on my pants, kinda looked
like I pissed myself like a big baby.

22:47.825 --> 22:49.705
So what I did was, I just
took off all my pants

22:49.869 --> 22:51.786
and I put it in the water
just to make it all completely wet.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.580
You know, that way I figured
no one would really notice.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.582
So, you know, it wouldn't be as bad.
I've got it under control.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.000
I've sorted it out. We're good.

22:57.460 --> 23:00.920
Yes. So you felt this wouldn't look as bad.

23:01.839 --> 23:03.173
- Understood.
- Yeah.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.425
But, Richard?

23:06.635 --> 23:10.388
Consider that maybe this might not be
the best choice for the meeting?

23:10.931 --> 23:13.558
Yeah. Holy...

23:14.101 --> 23:15.518
What the fuck am I doing?

23:16.145 --> 23:17.687
I can't go like this to the meeting.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.398
Jared. I have no vision.

23:20.649 --> 23:21.775
Yes, you do.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.487
- I believe in you...
- No, no, I literally have no vision.

23:25.571 --> 23:29.032
All I see is stars and swirls.
I cannot see right now.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.367
- Okay, okay, let's get your pants on.
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)

23:31.660 --> 23:33.328
MONICA: Richard? Jared? Are you in there?

23:33.829 --> 23:34.829
Ohh.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.209
Hey, there's some weather over the ocean

23:39.335 --> 23:41.496
so Peter would love to get started.
Are you guys ready?

23:41.504 --> 23:43.505
Yep. All good. Be there in a jiffy.

23:43.589 --> 23:44.672
- Okay.
- RICHARD: Oh.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.259
Jared, I'm on a carpet in a bathroom.

23:48.719 --> 23:50.678
Yeah, okay.

23:50.971 --> 23:54.599
I know this isn't the best thing to say
to someone having a panic attack,

23:55.017 --> 23:56.643
but we need to hurry here.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.479
- Doing okay?
- Yes, much better.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.147
Nope. Worse.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.568
Richard, you're gonna listen to me
if you know what's good for you.

24:05.694 --> 24:06.694
Erlich.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.655
I may have been wrong
about being a board member

24:08.739 --> 24:11.950
and I may be wrong about being
the Steve Jobs in our relationship.

24:12.076 --> 24:14.786
But I do know this,
you are the Steve Wozniak.

24:14.954 --> 24:18.206
And no Woz should go into
a meeting like that alone.

24:18.791 --> 24:19.874
No. Actually...

24:19.959 --> 24:23.128
So if you'll just let me come in,
then I won't speak.

24:23.212 --> 24:25.421
And I just think you should
have somebody in there

24:25.673 --> 24:27.382
who will actually have your back.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.553
Okay. No, I... Erlich, I
want you to be in there.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.346
Okay... Wait, what?

24:33.472 --> 24:34.806
Yes, and I need you to do all the talking.

24:34.890 --> 24:37.490
Because I feel like if I do
I'm gonna puke all over Peter Gregory.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.727
Oh. Okay. Wow.

24:40.271 --> 24:42.272
That was easier than I... All the talking?

24:42.940 --> 24:44.691
Oh, Erlich, you're here too?

24:45.401 --> 24:46.776
Okay. Come on in, guys.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.988
I'm going to stay here, I think.
Because I look absurd.

24:51.866 --> 24:53.324
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.243
So what are you going to say?

24:55.744 --> 24:57.162
Fuck, I don't know.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.080
(SIGHS)

25:02.751 --> 25:03.751
(WATER DRIPPING)

25:03.919 --> 25:06.671
Today's user wants access
to all of their files

25:06.797 --> 25:09.132
from all their devices instantly.

25:09.550 --> 25:11.551
That's why cloud-based is the Holy Grail.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.428
Now Dropbox is winning,

25:13.846 --> 25:15.805
but when it comes to audio and video files,

25:15.931 --> 25:18.141
they might as well be called Dripbox.

25:18.767 --> 25:19.767
(CHUCKLES)

25:20.311 --> 25:25.607
Using our platform, Pied Piper users would
be able to compress all of their files

25:25.941 --> 25:29.569
to the point where they truly
can access them instantly.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.529
We control the pipe,

25:32.448 --> 25:33.531
they just use it.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.659
That's the vision in
Richard Hendricks' head.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.129
Sure.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.465
Sounds fine.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.342
Oh.

25:52.426 --> 25:55.887
I received an email from Ron LaFlamme

25:56.180 --> 25:59.098
saying that this gentleman

25:59.516 --> 26:01.601
is going to be our third board member?

26:06.023 --> 26:08.107
Yes. Yes.

26:09.026 --> 26:11.527
Erlich helped me with all this stuff.
He's very talented.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.279
I need him as a partner.

26:16.367 --> 26:17.575
Fine.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.085
It's okay for you to leave now.

26:27.336 --> 26:28.544
All right, okay.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.843
Wait, is that you and Gavin Belson?

26:37.638 --> 26:40.682
Yes. it's an old photograph.

26:41.642 --> 26:42.684
Were you guys friends?

26:43.143 --> 26:44.352
I thought so.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.355
Good-bye.

26:51.235 --> 26:52.235
- How'd it go?
- (SHOES SQUISHING)

26:52.319 --> 26:53.569
That was amazing.

26:53.654 --> 26:56.155
I mean, that was like everything
in my head, but, like, clear.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.843
Did you just make that up on the spot?

26:58.200 --> 27:01.119
Yeah. We should probably
write some of it down.

27:01.287 --> 27:04.122
Yeah. Well, look. I gotta be honest,

27:04.248 --> 27:06.749
I mean, I can't tell you
how much this means.

27:06.875 --> 27:09.252
You really saved my ass
even after I was such a dick to you.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.713
- You're making up!
- What else could I do, Richard?

27:11.922 --> 27:13.256
You're my Wozniak.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.092
- And I will always be...
- (GROANS)

27:18.554 --> 27:19.554
(GRUNTS)

27:19.596 --> 27:20.638
Motherfu...
