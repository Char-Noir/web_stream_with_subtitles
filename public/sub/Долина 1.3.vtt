00:08.550 --> 00:10.270
GAVIN: The greatness
of human accomplishment

00:10.302 --> 00:12.345
has always been measured by size.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.263
The bigger, the better.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.765
Until now.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.517
Nanotech.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.185
Smart cars.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.895
Small is the new big.

00:23.774 --> 00:26.859
In the coming months,
Hooli will deliver Nucleus,

00:26.944 --> 00:31.364
the most sophisticated compression software
platform the world has ever seen.

00:31.448 --> 00:35.702
Because if we can make
your audio and video files smaller,

00:35.786 --> 00:41.374
we can make cancer smaller.
And hunger. And AIDS.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.500
DINESH: What an asshole.

00:43.293 --> 00:46.212
Why would he announce it
so far ahead of the actual rollout?

00:46.296 --> 00:47.505
No one does that.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.716
He's got to be doing it
just to fuck with us, right?

00:49.800 --> 00:52.051
I actually think we're okay.
The player I gave them

00:52.136 --> 00:54.345
was from a retired
repository that was audio only.

00:54.430 --> 00:56.222
Video compression
is a completely different paradigm.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.350
What they have is like Pied Piper,
but not as good.

00:59.435 --> 01:02.145
- People will see that.
- Not if they get to market before us.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.355
Inferior products win out all the time.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.691
Like Jesus over Satan.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.652
I was going to say VHS over Beta.

01:09.737 --> 01:13.239
Okay, well, actually this is a
superior product, right here.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.949
Is it a margarita machine?

01:15.033 --> 01:16.325
It's better.

01:17.369 --> 01:20.496
My first official purchase
as CEO of Pied Piper.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.915
That's not really our logo is it?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.251
It looks like a guy sucking a dick

01:25.335 --> 01:27.837
and he's got another
dick tucked behind his ear for later.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.923
- Like a snack dick. it does.
- No, it's a Pied Piper...

01:31.008 --> 01:33.843
Here, put them on. Gilfoyle, come on.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.052
I don't want it.

01:35.137 --> 01:38.723
Jared, I bought these
t-shirts with my credit card

01:38.807 --> 01:40.687
but I think I'm close to
being maxed out, so...

01:40.768 --> 01:43.394
Yeah, we may have a little problem there.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.813
Peter Gregory's check. So?

01:45.898 --> 01:48.149
So, it's made out
to "Pied Piper incorporated,"

01:48.233 --> 01:49.901
I checked with the secretary
of state website,

01:49.985 --> 01:53.279
and there's already
a Pied Piper operating in California.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.448
So we need to change our name.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.451
- Thank God!
- Praise the dark lord, that's great news.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.037
No, it's not great news.
We love the name Pied Piper.

02:01.163 --> 02:02.580
It's a classic fairy tale.

02:02.706 --> 02:03.831
Well, I looked it up.

02:03.916 --> 02:06.876
It's about a predatory flutist
who murders children in a cave.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.962
It has all of that going for it,
Richard, and I still hate it.

02:10.047 --> 02:13.257
Richard, if we are going
to change the name, we need to do it now.

02:13.342 --> 02:17.887
Names stick. My name's only Jared because
Gavin called me that on my first day.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.388
My real name is Donald.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.058
But, Jared, we already bought the T-shirts.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.435
I can't take these back.
It was an online order.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.937
What is that atrocity?

02:26.021 --> 02:28.064
What are we, an lrish pornography company?

02:28.232 --> 02:30.650
I thought we were gonna
replace the name "Pied Piper."

02:30.734 --> 02:32.193
I thought it was a place holder.

02:32.277 --> 02:35.488
"Placeholder" would honestly be
a better name than Pied Piper.

02:36.073 --> 02:39.325
Richard, I've actually been holding off
telling people I'm the co-founder

02:39.409 --> 02:42.662
of "Pied Piper" because frankly,
it's a little embarrassing.

02:43.330 --> 02:48.584
Well, just to remind you,
you are not the co-founder.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.378
So please don't tell anyone.

02:50.462 --> 02:55.174
Richard, take Aviato. That's not a name
I found, it's a name that found me

02:55.259 --> 02:56.759
on a vision quest.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.135
Something that you should do.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.264
No, no. I'm not gonna eat a bunch of drugs
and sit out in the desert,

03:01.348 --> 03:03.516
and hope some name
randomly pops in my head.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.268
Well, then I question your leadership.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.020
Richard, a name defines a company.

03:08.105 --> 03:13.276
It has to be something primal, something
that you can scream out during intercourse.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.278
Like Aviato.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.030
(MOANING)

03:23.954 --> 03:26.998
Exactly, right.
(MOANING) Pied Piper!

03:31.962 --> 03:37.091
I'm so sorry. Your voice doesn't really reach
that register when you ejaculate, does it?

03:37.175 --> 03:40.094
No, it's just, everyone was doing it,
I was just chiming in.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.346
(SIGHS)

03:55.736 --> 03:57.987
You guys, we can't change our name.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.448
I can't go into Peter Gregory's
office with a new name,

04:00.532 --> 04:01.893
and ask him to cut me a new check.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.327
I mean, he's pulled funding
from companies for a lot less.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.704
The Pied Piper name and trademark

04:06.788 --> 04:09.457
are registered to a sprinkler company
in Gilroy.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.626
I guess you could head out there
and talk to them.

04:11.835 --> 04:15.046
- But they may refuse...
- Okay. No, no, no. I'll negotiate with them.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.340
No offense, Richard,
but you're not a strong negotiator.

04:17.424 --> 04:20.092
- I'm a great negotiator, Dinesh.
- You're a terrible negotiator.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.094
I'm a decent negotiator.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.764
Just, so...

04:26.850 --> 04:29.101
Oh, Peter, you're here...

04:29.186 --> 04:32.355
We were supposed to meet 40 minutes ago
with the guys from Astraphile

04:32.439 --> 04:34.106
about the emergency capital injection.

04:35.192 --> 04:38.569
As we discussed,
our North Carolina plant went sideways.

04:38.654 --> 04:43.532
So we need 15 million now
or we'll have to shut down.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.622
Have any of you ever eaten at Burger King?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.376
Yes...
(CHUCKLES)

04:54.044 --> 04:55.044
Why?

04:55.170 --> 04:58.381
Well, I was just driven past one.

04:59.091 --> 05:02.760
And while I know their market cap
is $7 billion plus,

05:02.844 --> 05:06.389
I realize I am unfamiliar
with their offerings.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.890
Okay, fine.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.517
But what does that have to do...

05:09.768 --> 05:12.144
Is it popular among your peers?

05:12.729 --> 05:14.730
Is it enjoyed?

05:15.732 --> 05:17.650
- People seem to like it.
- Yeah, it's okay.

05:17.734 --> 05:21.320
And their selection
consists solely of these burgers,

05:21.405 --> 05:24.699
of which they are presumably king?
(CHUCKLES)

05:25.325 --> 05:28.160
They have other things. Chicken, fish.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.079
I'm sorry. What are we doing here?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.163
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

05:31.540 --> 05:32.999
Here is what we will do.

05:33.083 --> 05:38.337
Monica, have one of the assistants
go to the nearest Burger King location

05:38.630 --> 05:40.798
and purchase one of everything.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.597
JARED: Hey, Dinesh. Dinesh.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.435
I'm on the phone with the bank and they say
they need an extra form for your payroll,

05:52.519 --> 05:53.936
because of your visa?

05:54.021 --> 05:55.354
Visa? What visa?

05:55.439 --> 05:56.605
I'm a fucking US citizen.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.608
I have Dinesh Chugtai here,
and he's pretty irate because...

06:01.486 --> 06:02.945
Oh, I see...

06:03.864 --> 06:05.906
Bertram Gilfoyle is the foreign national.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.576
Citizen of Canada.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.910
Okay, thank you.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.121
You're Canadian?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.290
Your borders are merely a construct.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.126
I prefer to think of myself
as a citizen of the world.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.421
Do you mind just sending them
the form so they know you're here legally?

06:20.505 --> 06:21.714
Yes, I mind.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.674
And also I may not be.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.677
To wit, maybe you could
make out my checks to cash?

06:27.304 --> 06:28.554
Or bitcoin.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.556
I didn't know I was
working with an illegal.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.266
The irony.

06:33.769 --> 06:36.020
Well, sometimes we do center pivot,

06:36.104 --> 06:38.773
but mainly we do lineal
like you see out there.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.817
What is it your business does again?

06:42.027 --> 06:44.570
Something to do with algebra?

06:45.822 --> 06:47.156
Algorithm, actually.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.657
It's for compression.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.869
Ultimately what we're trying to do is...

06:53.330 --> 06:55.164
(CHUCKLES)
You remind me of my son.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.666
He's got Asperger's, too.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.001
Oh, no, I don't...

06:59.586 --> 07:02.129
Probably all those pesticides
they put on the crops.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.049
Well, whatever it is your business does,

07:05.133 --> 07:08.469
I don't think it's going to interfere
with my irrigation company here.

07:08.553 --> 07:12.014
I'm thinking about getting in
another line of work anyway.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.517
All these foreigners coming over here,

07:14.601 --> 07:19.063
putting pieces of shit like that
all over the good farmland around here.

07:19.231 --> 07:22.983
All so people can sit around,
stare at their phones all day.

07:24.569 --> 07:28.030
Nobody jerks off to magazines anymore.

07:32.035 --> 07:36.163
Well, actually, that is a server farm.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.832
What we do, compression,

07:37.916 --> 07:41.168
would mean fewer of those,
because we'd save a lot of memory space.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.129
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.422
Well, I'm all for that, believe me.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.550
I'll tell you what.

07:48.593 --> 07:52.555
You can have the name for $1,000.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.181
How's that sound?

07:54.266 --> 07:57.268
That sounds great! Yeah, cool.
(CHUCKLES)

08:01.648 --> 08:04.567
Oh, tremors, too?

08:05.652 --> 08:07.027
Just like my boy.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.323
Yeah.

08:13.451 --> 08:14.451
(CELLPHONE RINGS)

08:15.412 --> 08:16.537
Go for Erlich.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.456
This is Richard Hendricks,
CEO of Pied Piper.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.751
That's right. You guys said
I was a bad negotiator, but I closed it!

08:22.836 --> 08:24.879
We got a name. Tell everyone you know.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.922
Oh, all right.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.049
You don't sound that impressed.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.342
ERLICH: No, no, I am.

08:30.427 --> 08:31.635
I just...

08:33.096 --> 08:35.931
Now we're Pied Piper. So, later.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.020
Here you go.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.771
You must drink a lot of margaritas?

08:42.856 --> 08:45.065
We will now.
I have a startup that just got funded

08:45.150 --> 08:47.693
so this is just kind of
a gift for my guys to celebrate.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.362
Good luck with that.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.115
You'll need it, too,
when this town kicks you in the balls.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.742
- Okay. Sure.
- Let me get the door for you.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.660
I had three startups, myself,

08:56.745 --> 09:00.372
and I couldn't get those
Sand Hill Road morons to fund any of them.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.417
Cowards. My last company was genius.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.753
Have you ever been
lost in a parking lot before?

09:05.837 --> 09:09.215
See, what my app would do is
use existing AVL technology, right?

09:09.299 --> 09:13.594
So you would just type in the VIN number. And
if your car didn't have AVL capabilities

09:13.678 --> 09:16.680
you would just type in whatever section
of the parking lot you were in,

09:16.765 --> 09:19.391
like P3, or ground seven.

09:19.476 --> 09:22.311
So you just, you just write down what
section of the parking lot you're in?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.687
Why do you need an app for that?

09:23.772 --> 09:25.397
So you can remember where you parked.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.567
Right, but why don't you
just write it down on a piece of paper?

09:28.652 --> 09:30.736
Well, yeah. But this is for your phone.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.656
Okay, so it's just sorta like Notepad?

09:33.865 --> 09:36.742
- Exactly! See? You get it.
- Yeah. I get it.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.994
- Why can't all those fucking VCs?
- I don't know.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.162
- (CHUCKLES)
- Pussies, man.

Peter, I know that you are
incredibly busy with... This.

10:05.689 --> 10:08.732
But I made a personal promise
to the Astraphile guys

10:08.817 --> 10:12.569
that none of their employees would lose their
job, which will happen at midnight to...

10:12.654 --> 10:14.655
Do you see this?

10:15.198 --> 10:16.282
The Junior Whopper?

10:16.366 --> 10:19.201
No, not the sandwich.

10:20.245 --> 10:24.790
This seed atop the breading.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.208
Those are sesame seeds.

10:26.334 --> 10:30.379
A high number of these breadings
have sesame seeds on them.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.008
Billions of breadings.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.556
Sesame seeds.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.351
They only grow in certain microclimates.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.540
I just read Recode.net.

You read Recode?

11:51.795 --> 11:53.796
the name of my company's
all over the internet.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.716
But you'd probably think I'm just out here
shitting in a hole and wiping with my hand.

11:57.801 --> 11:59.468
No, no, no, I don't think you do that.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.228
If you're this tech billionaire,

12:09.312 --> 12:12.189
why did I give you the name
Pied Piper for next to nothing?

12:12.649 --> 12:14.066
You played me.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.569
You want the name,
it's going to cost you $250,000.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.739
Okay, I think you just need
to talk to the guy who said all that.

- He's outside with the intern.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.246
- What intern?
- You got interns?

12:27.330 --> 12:29.706
We might as well have interns,
we hire illegal aliens.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.751
- What?
- No, no. We don't have either of those things.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.294
I'll tell you what, asshole,

12:34.379 --> 12:37.464
you use the name Pied Piper again,
I'm going to call my lawyer

- That sounded sub-optimal.
- Yeah, it was.

Hey, Jared, you know who else is Canadian?
Justin Bieber, the Hitler of music.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.324
Do you have a problem
with me being Canadian?

12:54.691 --> 12:55.941
I do, actually.

Do you have any idea how long
it took me to become a citizen?

Did it take you a long time?

I'm glad I didn't do it then.

walk into this country...

walk into this country.

on the Ambassador Bridge.

It took me an extra 15 minutes
to get across the border. Major hassle.

You know, Hitler actually
played the bassoon.

was the Hitler of music.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.640
I don't understand.
I thought you closed the name.

Well, I guess it's still a
little ajar, I don't know.

all the gunk off the front bumper, okay.

And since when do we have
an intern program?

13:43.656 --> 13:45.824
We don't. And when Keith finds that out,

13:45.909 --> 13:48.327
it's gonna be a valuable

14:01.174 --> 14:02.633
that I wasn't a founder
of this company and now

14:02.717 --> 14:04.301
you want me to hold your hand
and help you out?

14:04.385 --> 14:05.761
I don't think so, sister.

So now the CEO of Pied Piper
can't even afford to buy lunch.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.608
Yeah, I don't think
we can use that name anymore.

14:26.157 --> 14:29.743
Dude! Dude, hey.
I owe you a big apology, man.

14:29.827 --> 14:33.413
I had no idea who you were
before and I read all this coverage

14:33.498 --> 14:36.500
about your company online,
and I was like, "Hey, Pied Piper!

14:36.584 --> 14:37.960
"I met this dude! He came into the store

was fucking awesome!"

14:40.922 --> 14:42.381
(STUTTERS)
I did?

14:42.465 --> 14:44.466
Yeah, so my mom was like, "Wow, really?

14:44.551 --> 14:46.051
"You should really pursue it!"

14:46.135 --> 14:47.803
And I was like, "Yeah, I should."

14:47.887 --> 14:49.304
The parking app?

14:49.389 --> 14:52.558
So she decides to get
a reverse mortgage on her home

14:52.642 --> 14:53.976
and write me a check.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.811
- Ooh...
- So I'm funded!

14:56.312 --> 14:57.646

14:58.314 --> 15:01.275
I was this close to giving up,
and now you gave me my dream back, man!

15:01.359 --> 15:03.485
- But...
- Oh, hey, Ron!

15:03.778 --> 15:07.155
You see this guy? This billionaire here?

15:07.240 --> 15:10.576
He's the reason why I'm quitting!

15:10.660 --> 15:14.746
- Jamie, no...
- Well, you've helped me so much,

15:14.831 --> 15:16.915
what can I do for you?

15:17.584 --> 15:18.584
(GULPS)

15:18.668 --> 15:23.046
Well, I need to return this machine because
I'm broke, and I need money for food.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.389
Just a quick question.

15:32.473 --> 15:37.728
Ls this gonna be a cash return,
or does it credit back to the card?

15:39.897 --> 15:45.652
All right, what about "Smaller,"
spelled "S-M-L-L-R"?

15:45.737 --> 15:47.738
You know, because we make things smaller,

15:47.822 --> 15:51.366
and this would be like
a smaller version of the word "smaller."

15:51.451 --> 15:53.535
- it looks like "smeller."
- Okay.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.246
What if we spell it...

15:57.665 --> 16:00.417
"S-M-L-R?"

16:01.044 --> 16:04.421
Because that's an even smaller
version of the word "smaller."

16:04.505 --> 16:05.839
Then it looks like Smiler.

16:05.923 --> 16:09.384
We're not gonna kick the shit
out of Nucleus with Smiler.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.518
Where's Richard?
Why isn't he in here for this?

16:11.596 --> 16:14.306
I think he was out back,
wishing he'd taken the $10 million.

16:14.390 --> 16:18.560
No, I just saw him in his room,
wishing he had taken the $10 million.

16:21.314 --> 16:25.025
You know Smiler is also something
that guys call women's assholes.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.988
Richard, why aren't you in there,
coming up with new names?

16:30.073 --> 16:33.283
I don't want a new name. I want Pied Piper.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.827
But, apparently, I can't have that.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.913
So now I have to come up with a new name

16:37.997 --> 16:40.457
and take that to Peter Gregory
and ask for a new check.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.960

business experience? No. None.

But he was such a tough negotiator
that now all of his friends are suing him.

Maybe something that you could actually do.

you would rather do nothing than something?

Because all the guys in the other room

17:15.785 --> 17:18.995

I'm really gonna go for this motherfucker

17:31.968 --> 17:34.136
so you better have some
grapefruit ready, too.

17:34.887 --> 17:39.474

that Peter Gregory will write us 10 checks.

17:42.645 --> 17:45.313

but where I'm from, that means a whole lot.

that name for $1,000.

What are we gonna do?

19:15.029 --> 19:16.655
If you keep screaming your name,

19:16.739 --> 19:19.074
it forces the assailant
to acknowledge you as a human.

- No, no, no, no.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.861
We don't have to...
We can keep it at the original $1,000.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.237
So, let's...

22:46.699 --> 22:50.910
- Okay, you got a deal.
- All right. Cool.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.120
We got a name!

22:52.288 --> 22:53.705
LnfoTrode...

22:54.582 --> 22:57.042
Cloud-based, disruptive platforms.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.419
Disrupting the cloud through...

22:59.503 --> 23:00.879
I said cloud twice, shit.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.089
Making the world a better place

23:03.340 --> 23:08.386
through cross-platform business
facing cloud...

23:08.471 --> 23:10.597
There's that... Shit!
There's that cloud again!

23:10.681 --> 23:13.725
Info-trode, info-trode?
What the fuck is info-trode?

23:13.809 --> 23:16.936
What is that?
It's all just fucking meaningless words!

23:17.021 --> 23:18.563
Okay. No, no, no...

23:18.647 --> 23:26.647
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.117
(MAN'S VOICE ECHOING)
Good-bye.

23:31.744 --> 23:39.292
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.169
- Making the world a better place.
- Sir?

23:41.837 --> 23:43.463
Are you okay in there?

23:43.547 --> 23:45.757
- Making the world a better place.
- He's been in there all night.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.634
I should call the sheriff.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.719
Making the world a better place.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.639
No, I... Hey, I told you
he's going to handle it!

23:52.723 --> 23:54.849
- Mr. Gregory, this is ridiculous.
- Sir...

23:54.934 --> 23:58.144
Mr. Gregory, we need an answer
and we need it now!

24:00.147 --> 24:03.108
- Yes?
- We need money. Now.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.318
And I'm sure that Burger King
and sesame seeds

24:05.402 --> 24:07.529
and whatever else you've been
mumbling about in here

24:07.613 --> 24:09.280
all seem lovely to think about...

24:09.365 --> 24:11.491
Myanmar and Brazil.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.118
No, no! No more of this!

24:13.202 --> 24:15.787
Okay, are we getting the money or not?

24:15.871 --> 24:18.873
Will you please tell us
what the hell is going on?

24:20.835 --> 24:24.003
Amusing coincidence
that two of the three countries

24:24.088 --> 24:29.217
that provide the world's sesame seeds
have such large cicada populations, no?

24:29.718 --> 24:32.762
The cicadas of Myanmar
emerge every 13 years,

24:32.847 --> 24:36.391
while the Brazilian
cicadas emerge every 17.

24:36.892 --> 24:40.562
Next year they will hatch, simultaneously,

24:40.646 --> 24:44.107
for the first time in 221 years.

24:45.609 --> 24:48.111
Crops from both countries
will be decimated.

24:48.654 --> 24:54.242
Unlike Myanmar and Brazil,
lndonesia has no cicada population.

24:54.326 --> 25:00.123
I was surprised to see lndonesian
sesame seed futures priced so low.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.500
I made a purchase.

25:02.585 --> 25:06.004
And now, if the shortage
spikes the global price

25:06.088 --> 25:09.424
even 10% we'll profit...

25:10.426 --> 25:12.760
- Evan?
- $68 million.

25:12.887 --> 25:16.097
If you wish, I could tap
that projected revenue and make you

25:16.182 --> 25:18.975
a bridge loan of $15 million, gentlemen.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.769
- (BOTH EXHALE)
- Unless you need more?

25:21.854 --> 25:24.189
No, that's... Thank you.
Thank you, holy shit.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.107
Yes? Happy?

25:26.358 --> 25:28.985
See? I told you he was taking care of it.

25:29.236 --> 25:33.448
And now, would anyone like some BK?

25:34.283 --> 25:36.951
(CHUCKLES) Evan was kind enough
to go out and get breakfast.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.578
It's just sitting here.

25:38.662 --> 25:42.373
- Actually, we'd... I'd love some.
- Thank you so much.

25:45.711 --> 25:49.130
Is there cumin in this barbecue sauce?

25:50.966 --> 25:53.593
- I will definitely find out.
- Please do.

26:01.602 --> 26:03.853
Gentlemen, we just got back from the bank.

26:03.938 --> 26:05.939
Our first deposit slip.

26:06.023 --> 26:08.149
We are officially Pied Piper.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.859
And I am officially legal.

26:09.944 --> 26:12.946
Dinesh wouldn't shut the hell up,
so we finally went to the visa office.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.489
Took me five minutes.

26:14.573 --> 26:18.868
Took me five years. They asked me
about Al-Qaeda, like, 14 times.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.746
He literally got it while
I was still looking for parking.

26:21.830 --> 26:22.830
(CELLPHONE RINGS)

26:24.208 --> 26:26.709
- Hello.
- WOMAN: Is this Pied Piper?

26:26.794 --> 26:30.546
It is now, but we're not taking
any follow-on investors at this point.

26:30.631 --> 26:35.468
Investors? No, this is Kelsey
from the Arco station out on 108.

26:35.552 --> 26:39.931
Someone smeared your name
and number in shit on my bathroom wall.

26:40.015 --> 26:43.935
- I think you may have the wrong number...
- Richie.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.187
Oh, hey, guys.

26:47.982 --> 26:49.774
Hi. Who is this?

26:49.858 --> 26:52.527
You're not gonna believe
this, but this is me.

26:52.611 --> 26:57.115
Time is a sphere and I've been reincarnated
during the same time period in which I exist.

26:57.199 --> 26:58.700
Yes, but where did he come from?

26:58.784 --> 27:01.202
From the future, obviously.

27:01.287 --> 27:04.330
Also, from a parking lot
at a gas station in Sonora.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.375
He ate the whole bag of gold caps.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.002
Awesome!

27:10.421 --> 27:14.507
Erlich...
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

27:19.221 --> 27:22.223
So, should I call the cops now
before anyone else does?

27:22.308 --> 27:26.060
I just got an Amber Alert
for Rogilio Nunez.

27:26.603 --> 27:27.687
Yeah, okay.
